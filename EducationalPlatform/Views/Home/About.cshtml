                    <hr>
                    Most of the students encounter difficulties when trying to integrate with a project, reading it or adding more features.
                    Having a path for quickly exploring codebases may be as important as knowing problem-solving. Most of the students will explore codebases in a chaotic way, without being aware of the steps they take or only chasing a valid solution for their tasks. Frustration and lack of confidence in their skills are then the natural results when pre-built projects are read. This behaviour is the outcome of not having educational support for learning how to understand codebase’s characteristics. <br><br>
                    The primordial objective of this platform is building a structural model for picking up codebases,
                    and understanding the model behaviour in order to generalise it on different scenarios.
                    More side benefits that will be analysed are: improve code reading skills, appreciate tasks difficulty,
                    learn safe refactorings, and learn code review.
